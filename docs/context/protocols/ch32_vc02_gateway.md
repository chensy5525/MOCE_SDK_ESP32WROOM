# CH32 UART Bridge VC02 Protocol

This protocol document records the ESP32-side expected contract for VC02 over a CH32 UART bridge.

The CH32 VC02 bridge firmware is not available locally yet, so this contract is marked as draft. Before MOCE Designer treats this as a fixed capability, CH32 firmware must confirm the CAN IDs, payload fields, node-id behavior, ACK/status semantics, and UART forwarding chunk rules.

safe_defaults:
  - Do not dispatch a voice command unless its UART byte sequence is recognized.
  - Unknown VC02 bytes are logged and ignored.
  - Missing CH32 ACK/status must not trigger downstream module actions.
  - Keep VC02 parser independent from downstream module state machines.
unsupported:
  - Direct ESP32-WROOM UART access to VC02 in this gateway capability.
  - Inferring CH32 status fields before CH32 firmware confirms them.
  - Generating VC02 firmware or changing VC02 command words.

## CH32 Information Still Needed

The ESP32 component currently needs the future CH32 VC02 bridge code to confirm:

- Whether `0x730`, `0x732`, `0x733`, and `0x734` are the final CAN IDs.
- Whether a CH32 node id is included in status, ACK, or UART forwarding frames.
- Whether VC02 bytes are forwarded as raw binary bytes, ASCII text, or both.
- The maximum UART byte count forwarded in one CAN frame.
- Whether forwarded UART frames can split a VC02 command across multiple CAN frames.
- The exact status payload fields.
- The exact ACK payload fields and failure codes.
- The confirmed VC02 UART baud rate and UART format on the CH32 side.
